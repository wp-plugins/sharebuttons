== Description ==

Add sharing buttons to your blog posts for: Facebook, Digg, Twitter, Email, Reddit, StumbleUpon, etc.

Having large buttons for the top sharing sites results in a lot more sharing than a single-button that overwhelms users with lots of sharing options.

You can always change what buttons you want to appear.
