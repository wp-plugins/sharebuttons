Add sharing buttons to your blog posts for: Facebook, Digg, Twitter, Email, Reddit, StumbleUpon, etc.

== Description ==

The easiest way to add sharing buttons to your blog posts for:
Facebook, Digg, Twitter, Email, Reddit, StumbleUpon, etc.

The buttons appear only AFTER you have published your blog post.

You can always change what buttons you want to appear. 

= What makes it different from other sharing plugins? =
Having large buttons for only the most popular sharing sites is far more effective than a single sharing link that overwhelms users with tons of sharing options.

= Benefits =
1. Maximize your traffic (more than any other sharing plugin)
2. Increase SEO (via social media backlinks)
